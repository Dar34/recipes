Slow Cooker Tangy Tomato Pot Roast

Ingredients

6 medium yellow-fleshed potatoes, peeled and halved
8-10 carrots, peeled and halved if thick or left whole if thinner
1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced
1 Tbsp olive oil
Salt and freshly ground pepper
3 lb boneless beef roast inside or outside round, blade or cross-rib works well
2 cups (16 oz) tomato sauce or passata, makes lots of sauce, so can be a bit less
1/4 cup brown sugar packed
2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
2 Tbsp cider vinegar
2-3 fresh thyme sprigs or 1 tsp dried thyme leaves
1 tsp salt
Freshly ground pepper

Directions

1. 	Scatter the prepared potatoes, carrots, and onions in the bottom of a slow cooker.

2. 	On the stove top, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear beef roast 
	on both sides until well browned, about 3 minutes per side. Place beef on top of vegetables 
	in slow cooker.

3. 	In a medium bowl, stir together the tomato sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, cider 
	vinegar, salt and pepper. Pour over the roast. Scatter the fresh thyme sprigs over-top.

4. 	Place cover on slow cooker and cook on low for about 6-8 hours, or until beef is fall-apart tender.

5. 	Remove roast to a cutting board and cut in to slices. Meanwhile, combine cornstarch with water 
	and stir in to gravy with vegetables and let cook for a few minutes until gravy thickens a bit. 
	Taste gravy and season with additional salt and pepper, as needed. Return meat to slow cooker. 
	Gently stir to coat with gravy. Allow to cook a few minutes to re-warm the meat, then remove all 
	to a large platter or bowl to serve. Garnish with some chopped fresh parsley.
